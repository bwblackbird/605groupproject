# Regression Analysis of Student Exam Performance

## Project Overview
This is a group project for MATH 605: Applied Regression Analysis in Fall 2024, and aims to analyze student performance on an exam using regression analysis techniques. The dataset contains 19 factors, including hours studied, tutoring sessions, and attendance, that may influence exam scores. Our objective is to build and evaluate regression models to identify key predictors of student success.

## Project Goals  
1. **Understand Key Predictors**: Identify which factors most strongly influence student exam performance.  
2. **Model Development**: Build a multiple linear regression model to predict exam scores.  
3. **Evaluate Performance**: Assess model accuracy using statistical metrics such as \( R^2 \), RMSE, and residual analysis.  
4. **Communicate Insights**: Present findings with clear visualizations and actionable recommendations.
